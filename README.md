# XR phosphene simulations with Unity game engine.

## About
This repository contains a collection of Unity-based phosphene simulations in mixed reality (XR) across different platforms. Note that this code is mainly intended for simple demonstrations of our visual prosthetics research. The simulations in this repository are relatively basic and are missing some of the biologically realistic features that were developed in other projects [on cortical stimulation parameters](https://github.com/neuralcodinglab/dynaphos) or [eye movements](https://github.com/neuralcodinglab/SPVGaze).
